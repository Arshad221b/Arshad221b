 1) Implementation of complex models from scratch and not just a toy version
 2) Train a large model on multi-GPU clusture, which involves not just the training but the entire jazz
 3) Valuable contribution to an opensource project
 4) Data scientist with capability to reason model performance and not just build, trial and error.
 5) Writing a clean and optimized code
 6) Being less pretentious, and writing more code than words :)
