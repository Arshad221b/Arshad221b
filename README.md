# Hi, I’m Arshad Kazi

I’m a Data Scientist with some industry experience. These are the projects/experiments I do in my free time (purely out of interest). For more professional (/industrial) info please refere to my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arshad221b/) profile. 

I’m particularly interested in computer vision and multi-model systems that understand the world by looking at it. I love understanding these systems from the inside out. Instead of just using models, I rebuild them to learn how they actually work. 

Most of my recent work explores self-supervision, pose estimation, image segmentation, and retrieval-augmented generation. I enjoy turning research into fully working systems—modular, testable, and often local-first (or on some small cloud GPU).

## Recent Computer Vision Projects

### DINO from Scratch  
A full reimplementation of DINO (Self-Distillation with No Labels) using PyTorch and Vision Transformers. The project focuses on contrast-free self-supervised learning using momentum encoders, centering, sharpening, and multi-view alignment.

### 2D to 3D Human Pose Uplift  
A transformer-based system that lifts 2D pose keypoints to 3D, inspired by MotionBERT. Includes full training pipeline, temporal modeling, and 3D visualization of predictions.

#### Natural Language Processing Projects

##### RAG on PDF  
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that reads PDFs and answers natural language questions. Built using LangChain, FAISS, and LLMs with a focus on local-first privacy and fast contextual retrieval.  
[Repo](https://github.com/Arshad221b/RAG-on-PDF)

##### Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
NER system built using Huggingface’s RoBERTa model. Includes token classification, training loop, data preprocessing, and clean inference pipeline.  
[Repo](https://github.com/Arshad221b/Named-Entity-Recognition)
